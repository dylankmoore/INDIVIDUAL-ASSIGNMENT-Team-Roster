## About the User
-The ideal user for this application is a member or admin of a dance/ballet company wanting to keep up with various companies and their members. 
-The problem this app solves is for companies to be able to keep tabs on their roster and update/change them as needed.

## Features 
- When a user goes to the app, they will need to log in via google auth to continue.
- Upon logging in, the user will be presented with a welcome screen and a navigation bar that will take them to the different teams, members, and the ability to create new members, as well as an option to sign out of the app.
- Each individual user that logs in will have to create their own team members as it is based on the user's ID what appears on the app.
- The user will be able to: view, edit, delete, and search all members of a team.
- When the user logs out, it will take them back to the log in page.
